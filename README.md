## Description
👩🏻‍💻

portfolio application was developed and designed to showcase my web applications and skills to potential employers, clients, and interested parties. It was created using React an open sourced JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Material-UI, a popular component library that implements Google's Material Design. Efficient rendering through the virtual DOM, and a declarative syntax. It operates via a one page application, but gives the user experience of multiple page functionality.
